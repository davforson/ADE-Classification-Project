Adverse Drug Event Classification

This project focuses on classifying patient reports on drug use as either an adverse drug event (ADE) or not. The goal is to assist clinicians in making informed decisions by leveraging machine learning to analyze and categorize reports effectively.

Key Features

Clinical Relevance:  
Adverse drug events are a significant concern in healthcare, leading to patient harm and increased medical costs.  
This model aids clinicians by automating the detection of ADEs, reducing manual effort and errors.  

Real-World Application:  
Improved Decision-Making: Provides clinicians with actionable insights from patient reports.  
Time-Saving: Automates ADE classification, allowing healthcare professionals to focus on critical cases.  
Patient Safety: Enhances drug monitoring systems to reduce adverse outcomes.  

Model Advantages

High Accuracy:  
Utilizes machine learning algorithms to achieve reliable classification results.  

Scalability:  
Can be integrated into existing healthcare systems for real-time ADE monitoring.  

Customization:  
Adapts to specific drugs, demographics, or clinical settings for personalized insights.
